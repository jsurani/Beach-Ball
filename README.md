# Beach-Ball
alien tries to catch beach ball, +1 point when caught and then the ball relocates to a random position.
Created a game with a player controlled Alien and a Ball that moves randomly and bounces off walls. The Alien moves with arrow keys, and collisions increase the score, tracked with a global variable, while the Ball resets with new speed and position.
